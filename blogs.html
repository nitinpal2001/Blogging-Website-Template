        <p class="font-1"><strong>What is Video Blogging?</strong> <br> <br>
            Like any other form of Blogging, video blogging (vlog) is done with the help of videos. You either self host
            your video or use free services like YouTube, Vimeo to host your videos. Like a normal blog, your video will
            be visible to public and they can rate, comment and share your videos. Only big difference is we will be
            using videos to share the information instead of text.

            For example, I could have simply created a video talking about benefits of video blogging and upload it on
            YouTube. A brand, can talk about how to use their product and other information. Since videos are
            interactive and give more detailed information, people often turn to look for video reviews, walk-through
            and tutorials.
            <br> <br>
            <strong>Advantages of Video Blogging:</strong> <br> <br>
            Depending upon your strategy, you can host videos on free video hosting site like YouTube (with few
            limitations), Vimeo, metacafe and many more or better host content on your site and allow users to embed
            videos on their site, which will give more exposure to your brand and videos. Though, for personal video
            blog, you need to make sure you have good command over Spoken English and you can prepare a proper strategy
            for complete video marketing plan.
            Professional companies and media brand can hire professionals to create awesome videos for them and
            especially, you can work on creating a related content strategy for video blog to educate your readers and
            drive more people. For example: if you are selling video hosting services, you can create videos on what all
            features of self hosted hosting should offer. This way, you are not only educating people but also driving
            client to your site. You can apply similar strategy for your brand. <br> <br>
            <strong>Getting Started:</strong> <br> <br>
            To launch your vlogging journey, create an account on YouTube. Anyone's allowed to upload content to
            YouTube; you don't need a special creator account to upload. <br> <br>
            <strong>Content Tips:</strong> <br> <br>
            Effective vlogs are generally short and personal. In most cases, a vlog entry shouldn't be fewer than two
            minutes long or longer than six minutes longâ€”research suggests that too-short, or too-long, of videos
            dissuade viewers.
            The goal is to post frequently and authentically. It's better to post a half-dozen times per week with a
            webcam or your phone camera than to post twice a month but emphasize studio-quality glossiness. <br>
            Because vlogs are a more personal form of content, over-producing them (with screen crawls, too-good of
            video quality, etc.) is generally off-putting. That said, unless you're already famous, most people aren't
            all that interested in unstructured rambling. So develop a plan, and every now and then, bring in a special
            guest. Keep it varied.
            But remember, frequency is more important than polish. <br> <br>
            <strong>Growing Your Vlog:</strong> <br> <br>
            Vlogs grow, but the more you promote them, the better you'll be. Promoting your content on social-media
            channels like Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest will help, depending on the kind of content you share.
            Likewise, tying your Vlog's URL to your social profiles promotes natural discovery.
